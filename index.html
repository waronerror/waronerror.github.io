War On Error
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Nov. 27, 2016<br><br>
    There is now a war between fact and fiction posing as fact.
    Good decisions require good and complete information.
    Similarly, errors in information produce errors in decisions.
    Misinformation is being used as a weapon to confuse, mislead, and manipulate our citizenry.
    The proliferation of misinformation is a critical threat to a peaceful, prosperous, and fair society.
    Although viewpoints differ, uniting around the minimization of error in information throughout our discourse should be a given.
    This is an evolving record of our corrections to misinformation, our dissemination of cogent arguments, and our editorial opinions.
